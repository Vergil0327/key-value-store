# Add Caching to Key-Value Store

Assume you have a subsystem, `KeyValueStore`, that can get and set key-value data in permanent storage.
- Please design and implement an in-memory cache to be used inside of `KeyValueStore`.
- The keys and values are ASCII strings.

## Requirements
- Support configuring the maximum storage size.
  - storage size is defined as the sum of the number of bytes of all keys and values
  - This definition is intentionally simplified so don't count the size of other on-disk or in-memory data structures and metadata.
- Support both read-through and write-through caching strategies.
- Support configuring the cache replacement policy. Your implementation should support FIFO and provide the flexibility for adding another policy such as LRU in the future.
- Support get and set methods.
- All operations must be thread-safe.
- Add unit tests to increase confidence in the correctness of your implementation
- Write necessary comments to help readers understand the code.
- Write a README file with step-by-step instructions on how to build and run the tests.
- Choose one of Golang, Python, C, C++, or Java as your implementation language

To simplify the implementation, use a fake `KeyValueStore` which pretends to load and store data from permanent storage but actually just use an in-memory data structure.

For example, hereâ€™s a version of `KeyValueStore.get()` using a read-through strategy in Python:

```python
class Cache(object):
    def get(self, key):
        # TODO
        return None

    def set(self, key, value):
        # TODO
        pass

class KeyValueStore(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._store = {}
        self._cache = Cache()

    # NOTE: this code is not thread safe. Your code should be.
    def get(self, key):
        value = self._cache.get(key)
        if value is not None:
            return value
        value = self._store.get(key)
        if value is not None:
            # Use read-through strategy.
            self._cache[key] = value
        return value
```

Please send us your code along with the README file.
